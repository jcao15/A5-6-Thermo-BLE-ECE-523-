# A4: Real-time smartphone sensor data processing. Accelerometer/Gyroscope applications (Jeremy Cao)

## Overview

I built an Android app to detect shake action in two modes in response to sensors on the device.

## Using the app 

There is two button in the main page that are clickable to enter different mode.
Free Mode: As user shaking the device, the counter will increment by shake detection.
User Defined Mode: As user set a target counter, once user shakes the device up to the number of target counter, device will be
automatically play a ringtone.

## Reflection/Summary

To Do:
-Pull-ups detector detects movements with “certain” accuracy.
- More accurate moving average filter implementation
